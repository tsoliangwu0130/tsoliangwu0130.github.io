			<h3>Hello, I'm Tso-Liang!</h3>
			<h5>Full Stack Developer | DevOps Engineer</h5>
			
			<p>I received my Master's degree in Computer Science (also Minor in Statistics) from Oregon State University in 2017. Right now I'm a full-time analysis programmer at <a href="http://is.oregonstate.edu/ecs">Enterprise Computing Services</a>. As a self-motivated learner, I can work alone efficiently. However, I'm also a good communicator and team member. Collaborating with diverse teams is much more fun and attractive to me.</p>

			<p>I enjoy learning new technologies and working on my personal projects using various tools (e.g. <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a>, etc.) in my spare time. Currently, I am obsessed with enhancing my DevOps skills and Full Stack development, but I am always open to all new things. Besides coding, I also love cooking, drinking beer, and creating some fun stuff with LEGO bricks.</p>
