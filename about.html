			<h3>WHO</h3>
			<p>Hello, I'm Tso-Liang!<br/>
			I recieved my Master's degree in Computer Science (also Minor in Statistics) from Oregon State University in 2017. Right now I'm an full-time analysis programmer at <a href="http://is.oregonstate.edu/ecs">Enterprise Computing Services</a>. I am also a Python lover. I enjoy learning new technologies and working on my perosnal project using various tools (e.g. <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a>, etc.) on my free time.</p>
			
			<hr/>

			<h3>WHAT</h3>
			<p>Recently, I migrated my old site from Bluehost to <a href="https://github.com/tsoliangwu0130">GitHub</a>. In order to implement some cool features for my personal website, I learned how to use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to design a website. In addition, I also built a very simple <a href="https://github.com/tsoliangwu0130/Furball-Bot">chat bot for Facebook Messenger</a> with Django framework. I really enjoy the process of learning new technologies and exploring fun stuff. Hope that I could share something new with you soon.</p>
