			<h3>WHO</h3>
			<p>My name is Tso-Liang Wu. I am a computer science grad student at Oregon State University, and I am also taking statistics as my minor. Currently, I am a RESTful APIs developer at Enterprise Computing Service, and I am learning <a href="http://www.dropwizard.io/0.9.2/docs/">Dropwizard</a>, <a href="http://gradle.org/">Gradle</a>, and <a href="http://www.groovy-lang.org/">Groovy</a> for working purpose right now.</p>

			<p>I am a Python lover. In order to use Python proficiently, I have taken the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python">specialization courses on Coursera</a> since 2015. Most of the time, I use Python as my prior programming language to solve problems. As a self-motivated learner, I am also learning <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> to build some fun stuff on my free time.</p>

			<h3>WHAT</h3>
			<p>Recently, I am working on my personal website project (it is this website!). I migrated my old site from Bluehost to <a href="https://github.com/tsoliangwu0130/tsoliangwu0130.github.io">GitHub</a>. In order to implement some cool features of my personal website, I am learning how to use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to design a website. I really enjoy the process of learning new technologies and exploring fun stuff. I hope I could share some new things I learned with you soon.</p>
