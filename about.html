			<h3>WHO</h3>
			<p>My name is Tso-Liang Wu. I am a Computer Science grad student at Oregon State University, and I also take Statistics as my minor. Currently, I am a RESTful APIs developer at Enterprise Computing Service, and I am learning <a href="http://www.dropwizard.io/0.9.2/docs/">Dropwizard</a>, <a href="http://gradle.org/">Gradle</a> and <a href="http://www.groovy-lang.org/">Groovy</a> for working purpose right now.</p>

			<p>I am a Python lover. In order to use Python proficiently, I took the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python">specialization courses on Coursera</a> in 2015. Most of time time, I use Python as my prior programming language to solve problems. As a self-motivated learner, I am also learning <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> to build some fun stuffs on my free time.</p>
			
			<h3>WHAT</h3>
			<p>Recently, I am working on my personal website project (this website does!). I migrated my old site from bluehost to <a href="https://github.com/tsoliangwu0130/tsoliangwu0130.github.io">GitHub</a>. In order to implement some cool features of my personal website, I am learning how to use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to design a website. I really enjoy the process of learning new technologies and exploring fun stuffs; I hope I could share what new things I learn with you soon!</p>
